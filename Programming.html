    <h1 style="color:whitesmoke;"><b>Why Is This One Of, If Not, My Favorite Hobby?</b></h1>
    <p style="color:white;">I am someone who has enjoyed playing video games for pretty much my entire life, and I don't think I'm alone in that. Looking back on the games I've played, it's safe to say that I'm a big Nintendo fan.
    In addition to playing a bunch of flash games on the computer, I played a lot on the GameCube (It was the first of many consoles that I have played). Games like Mario Kart, Mario Party, and Super Smash Brothers were so addicting to play (and the new versions today are just as good, if not, better).
    Through my elementary school journey, the Wii and the DSi replaced the GameCube as the consoles to play. There were a lot of games I've played on the Wii, but the one I remember playing the most on my DSi was Pokemon: Black and White. What an underrated game that was. Since then, there has been a massive evolution
    in video games and consoles from the 3DS, to the XBOX 360, to the PS4, to the Nintendo Switch. All of these consoles were just so fun to play during my free time. As I grew older, I started to wonder... what goes on behind the scenes? How are these games actually made?</p>
    <h1 style="color:whitesmoke;"><b>How I Learned About Creating Games</b></h1>
    <p style="color:white;">Before high school, I participated in a summer camp that was focused on programming and game design. I don't remember the software used to create these games, but they just felt so easy to use. While the games were simple and pixelated, there was a lot I could do to show off my creativity
    within these games (even if there were a limited amount of options available). Each character, or sprite, had an animation and had specific powers behind each action. Further learning of programming was rather sporadic throughout high school, but it is one of the most important parts of game design. At the same time,
    it is one of many, and there is a lot more to learn.</p>
