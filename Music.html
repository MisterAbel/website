    <h1 style="color:whitesmoke;"><b>My Journey Through Various Genres of Music</b></h1>
    <p style="color:white;">When I was much younger, I was someone who was interested in music through many ways. It was an alternation between pop and rock music for pretty much all of my life until middle school. I listened to a lot of rock music because of playing Guitar Hero.
    Never did I think that would be the reason I was attached to that genre. However my interest in rock alternated and eventually changed to mainstream pop. Initially that was because of the music I was listening to during P.E. But I became much more interested when one of my favorite radio stations suddenly changed.
    My interest in music was not just from the music I listened to, but the instruments I've played. I've taken piano lessons for a very long time (I want to say, up until high school). I also learned how to play the guitar and the drums. As a matter of fact, I've played drums in my middle school band and eventually in high school.
    While I was in high school, my interest in pop and rock diminished, as I eventually got attached to (and am still a fan of) a new genre: EDM. It was the newest craze, the biggest standout, and the newest trend in music... to absolutely nobody else at school, if I'm being honest. Listening to various DJs and their sets made me dream about having a set of my own.
    </p>
    <h1 style="color:rgb(43, 255, 75);"><b>Where Am I Now?</b></h1>
    <p style="color:white;">Now I've gotten myself into producing music. I was introduced to Soundtrap through my music technology teacher in high school. It was alright, and it was a free online service too, which was really helpful. To this day, I still use it to create background music for some of my videos when neccessary.
    But to set myself up as a "real" producer, I had to work through FL Studio. This application is where I'm creating the music I want to release to the public. Now I have a few tracks out, and some of them are on labels. It still feels like the beginning of my music producing career. </p>
