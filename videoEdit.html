    <h1 style="color:whitesmoke;"><b>How I Got Interested in Videomaking</b></h1>
    <p style="color:white;">During my senior year, I was trying to get hours for my internship in a tutoring program. Well, it wasn't really a tutoring program, but I was more of a teaching assistant for a middle school math class. I was working around 4 hours each week during classtime, which wasn't enough to fulfill the requirement of hours.
    So I found some time to work outside of class by creating tutorial videos for the students. I didn't have much to work with at first in terms of recording quality. I just recorded tutorials through my laptop, and I was editing through my already installed Microsoft editor at first before moving to Openshot. Once I learned more about editing videos, I used that to my advantage.
    I remember there was a moment in my music technology class a few weeks before I graduated, where we recorded and had to create a music video for a cover track. Let's just say that's an example of putting prior experience to good use. I sorted out this music video through Openshot, getting advice from my teacher when advice was needed. Had it not been for my knowledge and interest in video editing,
    setting up that music video in time... wouldn't have been as likely. </p>
    <h1 style="color:whitesmoke;"><b>Where Am I Now?</b></h1>
    <p style="color:white;">Now I've got myself a small YouTube channel, and at the moment, there's not much I'm doing apart from playing games. I'm having a lot of fun with each video, though. The process took a bit of time at first, as I was still working with Openshot. I eventually learned the art of transitions and working with sound effects. 
    I then found a new editing software in Davinci Resolve, and it was an absolute game-changer (no pun intended). There was a lot more to explore and learn, and there were a lot of ways to make my videos stand out. Most importantly, I really started to love editing my videos because of this new software. I'm still working with it now, and I think it's something I can make the most out of.</p>
